    "## Business Understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce businesses generate massive amounts of event data from customer sessions, product views, and purchases. Leveraging this data is critical for improving sales, strengthening engagement, and delivering personalized shopping experiences.\n",
    "Npontu Technologies collects large volumes of e-commerce event data,however the company currently lacks a structured way to translate this raw data into meaningful insights.The business wants to raise revenue, improve engagement, and tailor offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The company lacks clear signals to find at-risk customers, high-value buyers, and product opportunities. This gap limits the company’s ability to raise revenue, improve customer engagement, and deliver personalized experiences that keep customers coming back.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objectives \n",
    "- Increase repeat purchase rate by identifying and re-engaging at-risk customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grow average order value by targeting high-potential buyers with offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve conversion rate by optimizing product funnels and merchandising.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personalize marketing to reduce churn and raise lifetime value (LTV).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate a scalable pipeline (streaming or batch) to compute features in near real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "By leveraging on the CRISP-DM framework I will transform raw event logs into customer profiles, predictive models, and interactive dashboards. Npontu Technologies can gain actionable insights that drive revenue growth, enhance customer loyalty, and support data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Manager — decides promotions, product placements, UX changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Growth/Marketing Team — runs campaigns and needs segments and uplift targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Success Team — acts on churn predictions and win-back flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Engineering Team — builds ingestion and feature pipelines (Kafka, Spark).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Science Team — builds models and explains them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Leadership — reviews ROI, revenue impact, and prioritizes initiatives.\n",

    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following key files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. customers.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains customer-level information. Fields include customer_id, age, gender, location and signup_date\n",
    "\n",
    "2. sessions.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- Captures details about customer browsing sessions. This includes session_id, customer_id, session_date, product_viewed, browsing_time_sec,purchase_made and purchase_amount.This helps track how customers interact with the platform over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of the E-Commerce Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Churn risk list with confidence scores and top drivers per customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer segments (new, loyal, at-risk, high LTV) and recommended actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product funnel metrics: view → add to cart → purchase conversion by product.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time trends and seasonality: weekly/monthly demand peaks and campaign lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top revenue cohorts and product pairs for cross-sell suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dashboard for monitoring model performance and business KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features to engineer (data features to create)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RFM: recency (days since last purchase), frequency (# purchases), monetary (total spend).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Session features: avg session duration, pages viewed, product views per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recency buckets and days_since_last_purchase (for churn label).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavioral rates: add-to-cart rate, purchase_rate = purchases / sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product interaction features: top categories viewed, favorite category, cross-view counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal features: hour_of_day, day_of_week, month, days_since_signup, season flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Derived financials: avg_order_value, CLTV proxy (sum of orders over period), discount usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers with long recency (no recent purchase) and low session frequency are more likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7 Analytical Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which customers are likely to churn in the next 90 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use recency, frequency, monetary, session patterns, and recent activity as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which actions move at-risk customers back to buying?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test offers, email cadence, and personalized product recommendations (A/B test).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which product categories have the largest view → purchase leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify pages with high views but low purchases to target UX or pricing fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Who are the top 5% highest-value customers and what early signals identify them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a short-term predictor to flag future high-value buyers within first 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the average order value (AOV) by customer cohort and how can it be increased?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segment by acquisition channel, signup month, and product interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which product combinations or sequences suggest strong cross-sell opportunities?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use association rules or co-view / co-purchase analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does conversion and purchase behavior change over time (seasonality & campaign effects)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attribute lifts to marketing and note when retraining models is necessary.\n",
